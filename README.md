We understand that a proper solution to this assignment would take a couple of days, but please remember, a perfect 
solution does not exist! All we are looking for is the approach.

It is said that ‘Art Speaks where words fail to explain’, and considering the software craftsmen we are -

Please use this case study to portray the wide array or depth of your knowledge which 
generally will not be visible or even get asked during an interview. Interviews 
are constrained by the knowledge of the interviewer and time and many a times do not do justice 
to your knowledge!
  
Please see this as an opportunity to showcase your technical, logical, coding talents and 
creativity in your own style and time.

Like we mentioned above, a great solution would be self-exemplary of your skills and talent 
and eliminate the need for more evaluation.

Do not feel pressured to provide the “perfect answer”. The goal is for you to put forth your skills 
and give us an idea of how you approach tasks relevant to this role.
"ShopBridge" is an e-commerce application. As a part of this app, you need to build functionalities that 
helps manage different items they would have for sale. This will require a frontend/backend solution. As 
a Backend developer, you would be needing to provide a functional solution that can be consumed by 
the frontend application.
(In case of coding solution) Backend Requirements:
Server-Side Programming Language that you are comfortable with or interviewing for. (C# / Python / Java 
/ F# MockAPI https://mockapi.io/) to implement the APIs for "ShopBridge" for below actions.
Create a ‘Backend Solution’ or ‘Architectural Flow’ for Product module to be used by Product 
Admin, to perform below actions:
1. Add a new item to the inventory (The item should require a name, description, and price as basic 
fields, think of additional information that would be useful)
2. Modify an item in the inventory.
3. Delete an item from the inventory.
4. Lists the items in the inventory.

Assume a relational (SQL Server / MSSQL / Postgres) database and any ORM you feel comfortable with 
for any persistent data storage needs. All the functions of the backend need to be served by an API call 
and the store’s inventory should be persisted across restarts of the backend process.
1. All API calls should be asynchronous.
2. Include data validations as and when needed.
3. Exception handlings need to be present.
 
Consider this to be just an elementary starting point to get you going and is much smaller 
compared to the expanse of your knowledge!

Please feel free to demonstrate the width and creativity of your coding with handling of 
functionalities like business validations, image processing, stock manipulation, categories, 
search etc. along with technical pieces like exception handling, pagination...
Great Add-on to have:
1. Simple and minimal design, you can mention Nuget packages you are comfortable with and why 
would you prefer them.
2. Supporting relevant documentation (Document/ Diagram of Architecture Design for the 
application
